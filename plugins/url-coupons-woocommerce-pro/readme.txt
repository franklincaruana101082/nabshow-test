WooCommerce URL coupons.

== Description ==

**URL Coupons for WooCommerce plugin** allows your customers to apply coupons via URL.

= How it Works? =

After you install and activate plugin, all your shop's coupons can be applied by your customers by visiting `http://example.com/?alg_apply_coupon=couponcode`.

You can customize `alg_apply_coupon` key in plugin's settings.

Also you can optionally **hide standard coupon input field** on the cart and checkout pages, so coupons could be applied by URL only.

= Premium Version =

With [URL Coupons for WooCommerce Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/url-coupons-woocommerce/) you can:

* automatically **add coupon's products to the cart** for "Fixed product discount" coupons, and
* set **redirect URL**.
