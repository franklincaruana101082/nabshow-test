A REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce that’s Easy and Powerful.

== Description ==

### CoCart: The #1 REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce.

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) handles the shopping cart in any modern framework of your choosing. No local storing required. Powerful and developer friendly ready to build your headless store, **without building an API**.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. Not the API your needing for your customers who only see the frontend.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store for your customers then CoCart is your solution.

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/) provided, you’ll learn how to enable the ability to add products to the cart and manage it in no time.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart’s core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce v3.6 or higher installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation. That’s it!

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. Not the API your needing for your customers who only see the frontend.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your solution.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for store owners and developers. If you want to create an e-commerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API, then you need to use CoCart.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin is built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

The documentation for CoCart can be [found here](https://docs.cocart.xyz/).

You certainly can. Filters are available to do just that. [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided. [View the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/) for more.

= Does it work with any of the official WooCommerce libraries? =

Only if you request your customers to be logged in. This is because all the official libraries require authentication which the cart does not require.

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues).

= Is CoCart translatable? =

== Changelog ==

= v2.5.0 - 10th August, 2020 =

This minor release adds support for the recent changes made to the REST API in the coming WordPress 5.5 to allow CoCart to still work as it is a public REST API.

No changes have been made to the API it self. Just made sure that each route has the correct permission call back applied.

If you are still using the legacy API and have updated to WordPress 5.5, then you will no longer be able to use it as it will no longer register.
